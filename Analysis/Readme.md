### Infographic 1: Annual Battle-Related Deaths vs. Crude Suicide Rate
This scatter plot visualizes the relationship between the magnitude of armed conflict deaths and the crude suicide rate in a given country per year. This chart suggests a positive correlation (r=0.69) between the number of annual battle-related deaths and the crude suicide rate, which indicates that the years that countries experience high levels of violent conflict tend to have higher overall suicide rates.


### The question whether the type of conflict (who is fighting whom) makes a difference in the population's suicide rate. The analysis below is based on the querys.

The table and bargraph below shows the average suicide rate calculated across all country-years for four different conflict categories:

|Conflict Type|Average Suicide Rate (per 100,000|Average Annual Deaths|
|-|-|-|
|One-sided|24.13|3506.57|
|Intrastate|14.61|2059.12|
|Non-state|10.57|525.00|
|None|5.90|27.00|

## The analysis shows that the highest average suicide rates are found in places suffering from two specific types of trauma: One-sided violence and Intrastate conflicts (civil wars).
One-sided violence is when a government or an armed group intentionally targets and attacks its own civilians. This suggests that violence directly targeting or broadly affecting the civilian population may have a much stronger impact on public mental health than other forms of conflict.

Intrastate conflicts (e.g Civil War) leads economic damage, institutional weakening, and social disruption at the individual, state, and interstate levels. This disruption of daily life and social structure may have a severe impact on public mental health.
